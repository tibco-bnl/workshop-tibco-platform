# Adding MicroK8s to Kubeconfig and Accessing with OpenLens
.. so that you can use openLens or your favorite kubernetes client like kubectl to interact with.

## If you already have openLens or other k8s client, jump to Step2 > substep 4.

## Step 1: Install OpenLens using Chocolatey

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Run the following command to install Chocolatey if you haven't already:
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
    ```
3. Install OpenLens using Chocolatey:
    ```powershell
    choco install openlens
    ```

## Step 2: Add MicroK8s to Kubeconfig from WSL Ubuntu

1. Open your WSL Ubuntu terminal.
2. Ensure MicroK8s is installed and running:
    ```bash
    sudo snap install microk8s --classic
    sudo microk8s start
    ```
3. Add your user to the `microk8s` group to avoid using `sudo` for every command:
    ```bash
    sudo usermod -a -G microk8s $USER
    sudo chown -f -R $USER ~/.kube
    newgrp microk8s
    ```
4. Export the MicroK8s kubeconfig to your default kubeconfig file:
    ```bash
    microk8s config > ~/.kube/config
    ```

## Step 3: Access MicroK8s using OpenLens

1. Open OpenLens from the Start Menu or by running `openlens` in PowerShell.
2. In OpenLens, go to the "File" menu and select "Add Cluster".
3. Choose "Kubeconfig" and ensure the path is set to your kubeconfig file (usually `~/.kube/config`).
4. Click "Add Cluster" to connect to your MicroK8s cluster.
5. If that doesn't work, just display microk8s config on the console and copy-paste it manually and add to open lens (add cluster using kubeconfig).

You should now be able to manage your MicroK8s cluster using OpenLens.
