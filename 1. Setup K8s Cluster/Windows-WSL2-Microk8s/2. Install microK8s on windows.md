    sudo chown -f -R $USER ~/.kube
    ```

4. **Apply Group Changes**

    ```

6. **Enable Common Services**
    ```bash
    microk8s enable dns 
    microk8s enable dashboard 
    microk8s enable storage
    ```
    

7. **Access Kubernetes Dashboard**
    ```bash
    microk8s dashboard-proxy &
    ```

    7.1 **Access Kubernetes Dashboard in Browser in case you missed the token from last time**

    ```bash
    # Get the token for accessing the dashboard
    token=$(microk8s kubectl -n kube-system get secret | grep default-token | cut -d " " -f1)
    microk8s kubectl -n kube-system describe secret $token
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:10443`. Use the token obtained from the above command to log in.


8. **Create aliases as functions for convenience**
    ```bash
    echo 'mk() { microk8s "$@"; }' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'mkl() { microk8s kubectl "$@"; }' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    Also, add to root's .bash in case if you are using sudo
    ```
    sudo vi /root/.bashrc 
    ```
    Note: If mkl is giving permission issues, then add the user again to microk8s group. Step 3. and 4.

9. Export the MicroK8s kubeconfig to your default kubeconfig file:
    ```bash
    microk8s config > ~/.kube/config
    ```

You have successfully installed microk8s on WSL2 Ubuntu on Windows.

> **Note:**
> - This script installs MicroK8s using the snap package manager.
> - Snap is a software packaging and deployment system developed by Canonical for the Linux operating system. It allows developers to distribute their applications directly to users in a secure and isolated environment.
> - The `--classic` option is used to install the snap in classic confinement mode, which gives the application full access to the system, similar to traditional Linux package managers. This is necessary for applications that require extensive interaction with the system, such as MicroK8s.
> - Adding aliases for `microk8s` and `microk8s kubectl` commands can save time and make it easier to work with MicroK8s.
> - Adding functions for `mk` and `mkl` ensures that all command options for `microk8s` and `microk8s kubectl` are resolved correctly.
