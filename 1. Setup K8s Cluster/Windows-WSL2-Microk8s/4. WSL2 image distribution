### Create wsl snapshot of WSL2 Ubuntu image
---
1. Terminate all terminals with WSL2 Ubuntu sessions


2. Shutdown WSL2
    In Windows Powershell stop WSL2 (may result in warnings from docker desktop)

    ```powershell
    wsl --shutdown
    ```

3. Export distribution

    ```
    mkdir $env:USERPROFILE\wsl-backup
    wsl --export Ubuntu %UserProfile%\wsl-backup\Ubuntu_01_minikube.tar
    ``` 
    This may take a couple of minutes depending on the size of the distribution
---

### Import wsl snapshot on other machine
---

1. Terminate all terminals with WSL2 Ubuntu sessions


2. Shutdown WSL2
    In Windows Powershell stop WSL2 (may result in warnings from docker desktop)

    ```powershell
    wsl --shutdown
    ```

3. Unregister existing distribution 

    This will cause the existing distribution to be completely removed. Please make an export if any data in the distribution is required for future use.

    ```powershell
    wsl --unregister Ubuntu
    ```

3. Copy the wsl export file (tar) to the target machine

    ```
    mkdir -p $env:USERPROFILE\wsl\tars
    ```
    Copy the tar file to this directory
    
4. For the import an path is required to act as install location. Here the imported distribution will be created
    ```
    mkdir -p $env:USERPROFILE\wsl\installLoction
    wsl --import Ubuntu $env:USERPROFILE\wsl\installLoction $env:USERPROFILE\wsl\tars\Ubuntu_01_minikube.tar
    ```

    This may take a couple of minutes depending on the size of the distribution

5. Show distributions

    ```
    wsl -l -v
    ```
    The imported distribution (here 'Ubuntu') will be present.

6. Set the newly imported distribution as default

    ```
    wsl --set-default Ubuntu
    ```

7. Set default user to tibco user instead of root

    In this example user tibco was used as the main user upon inital creation of the distribution
    ```
    ubuntu config --default-user tibco
    ```
